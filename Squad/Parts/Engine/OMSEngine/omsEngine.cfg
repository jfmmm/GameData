title = O-10 MonoPropellant Engine
manufacturer = Reaction Systems Ltd
description = When The O-10 Engine was first unveiled, it was regarded as one of those ideas that someone should have thought of a long time ago. This made most employees at Reaction Systems Ltd feel quite awkward, as they were particularly proud of having delivered this project on schedule for once. This Engine responds to main throttle controls, but it consumes MonoPropellant instead of a Fuel+Oxidizer mix.
